EchoTestFutures.py - a simple benchmark used to determine how fast SNAPconnect can
communicate with a directly connected bridge. We use this to evaluate different
Python platforms, implementations, and serial drivers.

This example demonstrates one way to maximize throughput without choking the network.

Refer to comments throughout this file, plus the accompanying README.txt.

# 2) You are benchmarking a remote node, and it is so many hops away that 1 second is too short.
